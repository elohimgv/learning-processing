# Learning Processing A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Programming Images, Animation, and Interaction

From [lesson 1 to lesson 5](https://github.com/elohimgv/learning-processing/tree/master/lesson_1_to_5/toki) from the book I worked throught a project named [_toki_](https://github.com/elohimgv/learning-processing/tree/master/lesson_1_to_5/toki) to apply what have been learned. After that  I have been road the book exercises.
